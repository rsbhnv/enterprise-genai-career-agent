# 🤖 GenAI Career Agent – Architecture & Conversation Design

## Overview
This repository describes the architecture and conversation design of an
**enterprise-grade GenAI career agent** that assists candidates in discovering
relevant job opportunities, validating basic eligibility, and navigating
the application process.

The solution is designed to reduce irrelevant inquiries, improve candidate
experience, and support workforce planning by combining deterministic decision
logic with GenAI-powered free-text conversations.

All descriptions are intentionally generic and sanitized to preserve
organizational confidentiality.
